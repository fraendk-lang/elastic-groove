/**
 * AudioWake — centralized handler for AudioContext suspend/resume edge cases.
 *
 * Browsers suspend the AudioContext (or aggressively throttle the main thread
 * that schedulers run on) when:
 *   - Tab loses focus / visibility
 *   - Window is backgrounded for too long
 *   - System sleeps then wakes
 *   - iOS Safari aggressively suspends without warning
 *
 * When the context wakes back up, three things can go wrong:
 *   1. AudioContext is still in "suspended" state and needs explicit .resume()
 *   2. Schedulers' nextStepTime is far behind ctx.currentTime → catch-up while
 *      loop fires a burst of stale notes all at once
 *   3. Voices that were triggered before the suspend may have lost their
 *      release events → ghost notes
 *
 * This module centralizes the wake-up: a single global focus / visibility
 * listener calls `wake()`, which:
 *   - Calls audioEngine.resume() (no-op if already running)
 *   - Calls each registered "wake-up handler" so individual schedulers can
 *     clamp their nextStepTime forward and clean up stale state
 *
 * Schedulers register via `registerWakeHandler()`, return an unsubscribe.
